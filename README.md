# Electricity-Theft
This repository contains the dataset generated for the paper "Electricity Theft Detection in the Presence of Prosumers Using a Cluster-based Multi-feature Detection Model" submitted to the IEEE SmartGridComm2021 conference "IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids".

Dataset Title: Generated Smart Grid Dataset with Multi-dimensional Features 
  

Grid Taxonomy: The R1-12.47-2 distribution feeder developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). The taxonomy details can be found here https://github.com/gridlab-d/analysis/blob/master/PublishedReports/2008%20-%20Modern%20Grid%20Initiative%20Distribution%20Taxonomy%20Final%20Report.pdf


Files: 
1. electricity_readings.part001.rar to electricity_readings.part032.rar are compressed files that can be uncompressed to get the main cleanedData.pkl file.  cleanedData.pkl is the main file that contains all the electricity dynamic features.
2. consumers_master_info.pkl is a pkl file that contains the static features of all consumers in the grid.
3. prosumers_master_info.pkl is pkl file that contains the static features of all prosumers in the grid.


Files Format: All files are pkl files that can be loaded into Python Pandas object.
